**Overview**

The Password Generator is a Python-based console application designed to create secure, randomized passwords of varying complexity. It allows users to specify the desired length and includes options to incorporate letters, numbers, and special characters. The tool ensures strong password formation by using Pythonâ€™s built-in random library and well-structured program logic. This project demonstrates my understanding of loops, lists, functions, and randomization techniques to build a practical security-focused application.

**Learning Objectives & Technical Implementation**

This project strengthened my knowledge of Python fundamentals and improved my ability to design user-interactive programs.

Concept & Description

1. Randomization for Security - Used the random module to shuffle and select characters, ensuring passwords are unpredictable and secure.

2. Lists for Character Storage - Stored letters, numbers, and symbols in separate lists, allowing dynamic construction of password combinations.

3. User Input Handling - Collected input for:
Number of letters
Number of numbers
Number of symbols
Converted inputs appropriately to generate customized passwords.

4. Loops for Character Selection - Implemented for loops to append random characters from each list according to user requirements.

5. Shuffling for Extra Security - Combined all characters and used random.shuffle() to eliminate patterns and increase password strength.

6. Clear Output & Program Flow - Printed the final password in a readable format, maintaining a clean user experience.



**Example Interaction**
Welcome to the Python Password Generator!

How many letters would you like in your password? 5
How many symbols would you like? 2
How many numbers would you like? 3

Your secure password is: A9d$k4@8F
